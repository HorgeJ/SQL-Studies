# Relational Databases
A relational database is a set of formally described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables. The standard user and application programming interface (API) of a relational database is the Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL statements are used both for interactive queries for information from a relational database and for gathering data for reports.

## Normalization
the process of restructuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

## Set Theory
Set Theory was founded in 1874, and is a relatively new mathematical discipline, as compared to Algebra or Calculus.

[Introduction to Set Theory](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/)

Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory)
